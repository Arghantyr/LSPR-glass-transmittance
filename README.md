# What is lsprlib?

_lsprlib_ is a Python 3 scientific package for modelling UV-Vis spectral behaviour of metallic nanoparticle-dieletric composites.

# Dependencies

To run _lsprlib_ smoothly you will need:
1. Python 3.4+
2. Pandas 1.0.3+
3. NumPy 1.18.1+
4. SciPy 1.4.1+
5. Statsmodels 0.11.0+
6. Matplotlib 3.1.3+

# What does lsprlib enable?

_lsprlib_ enables one to approximate some spectroscopic features of metallic nanoparticle-dielectric composites, e.g. transmittance, absorbance, scattering cross-section. The model utilizes dipole approximation of Mie solution to Maxwell equations, described in more detail in article by Olson et al.<sup>1</sup>

To perform a simulation, one needs to construct a composite, so matrix and metallic nanoparticles, so for each a set of refractive index and extinction coefficient data for simulated spectral range are necessary. The model **does not take into account possible interactions at the nanoparticle/matrix interface**, i.e. the composite absorbance is a simple sum of matrix and nanoparticle absorbances calculated for pristine materials.

The transmittance of 31nm silver nanoparticles homogeneously distributed in vacuum with concentration 5.8 &middot; 10<sup>13</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>

```
import lsprlib as lpl

# Get the csv file with n,k values for silver in range 200-1000nm
# spaced evenly every 1nm
Ag = lpl.OpticalMaterial(name = "Silver",source = "n-k_Silver_200-1000nm_(1nm).csv")

# Get n,k values for vacuum
Vacuum = lpl.OpticalMaterial(name = "Vacuum",
                         source = "n-k_data_for_vacuum_200-1000nm_(1nm).csv")

# Create Ag nanoparticles with mean size of 31nm, standard deviation of 1nm
# and concentration of 5.8e13 cm^-3
nAg = lpl.Nanoparticle(name = "Silver nanoparticles", material=Ag,
                   size=31, concentration=5.8e13)

# Set the transmittance measurement of a 1 micron thick sample of the composite
(silver nanoparticles dispersed in vacuum); use "T_corr" for reflectance corrected result
Transmittance = lpl.SpectralMeasurement("Measure the transmittance",
                                    matrix=Vacuum, nanoparticle=nAg,
                                    thickness=3).plot_results("T_corr")
```
