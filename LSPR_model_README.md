# Modelling a transmittance spectrum of a glass-Ag nanoparticle composite

## Project description
The aim of this project is to utilise Python and Python data analysis libraries
to form a model for predicting transmittance spectrum of a glass-Ag nanoparticle
composite or estimate the mean concentration of those particles from the transmittance
spectrum. The initial version of the project enables only the prediction
of spectrum.

## Prerequisites - what You need to use this project
Jupyter with Python 3 environment.
